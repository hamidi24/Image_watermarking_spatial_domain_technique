This code contains an image watermarking method in the spatial domain. 

You can either launch the program separately using Embedding.m and Extracting.m, or  launch the Test_Watermarking_LSB.m script.

The PSNR metric is used here to assess the visual quality (imperceptibility) of the watermarking technique.
